# Ruairi's Neighborhood Map App
A Neighborhood Map App built with Knockout.js, Google Map API, flickr API and Firebase Realtime Database

## Description
This is Project 4 for the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree. I was required to build a map using Google Maps that shows selected locations of interest. The area I selected is New Orleans as I am planning to go there soon.
The locations should be filterable, and each location should display information pulled from a third-party API. The user also has the ability to add new locations to the map, and favourite each location

## Primary Features
- [x] Uses [Google Javascript Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) to generate the Map and Markers.
- [x] Uses [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/javascript/) to get data about each location
- [x] Calls [flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) to return Photos related to each location, and displays them in a carousel.
- [x] Dynamically reads and writes to a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) Realtime Database.
- [x] Uses [knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) to asynchronously update Map, add Markers and allow the user to dynamically filter the location list
- [x] Code is ready for personal review and neatly formatted.
- [x] Page is error free.
- [x] Comments effectively explain longer code procedures.
- [x] A `README` file includes details of all the steps required to successfully run the application.

## Extras
- [x] The ability for the user to Favourite a Location
- [x] Markers styled according to Favourite status and 'mouseover' events
